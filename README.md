# NER with Flair

This sample shows how to use [Flair NLP](https://github.com/flairNLP/flair) in .NET Core.

It uses [Python Included](https://github.com/henon/Python.Included) and [Python.NET](https://pythonnet.github.io/)
to embed Python in C#. 

At the first run Python and all the libraries used by Flair are downloaded in the `\bin\python-3.11.0-embed-amd64` folder.
Flair models are dowloaded in the `\bin\cache` folder.

Current version uses `Python 3.11.0` embedded.
